## About



### What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```


### What is Wakanda?

Wakanda Server and WakandaDB integrate of an HTTP server and a JavaScript engine on top of a fast NoSQL Object datastore to creates an unbeatable combination for accessing your relational data quickly with a strong business logic applied.

```bash
npm install -g generator-wakanda-project
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo wakanda-project
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.
